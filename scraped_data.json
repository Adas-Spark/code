We\u2019ve tried to learn from Ada and have fought to have fun and enjoy life even when we are in pain from missing her.\nThanks to your generosity we were able to spark some positive change in the world. Together we raised over $33,000 to support the fight against childhood cancer. See our attached year in review newsletter and sign up for the 2nd Annual Ada\u2019s Forever 5K (or 1-mile walk) here: https://adas-spark.org/adas-forever-5k/ .

The hospital staff was blown away by the quantity of fun toys. We feel so privileged to be the conduit of our community\u2019s generosity. We would like to especially thank Inspire Early Childhood, Lymphomaniacs, and LVLUP Martial Arts - Waunakee for letting us promote this event to their communities and the generosity of those communities!\nThese past few years have been very difficult for our family and any grace that we have mustered comes from the love and support we feel from our friends and the communities we are fortunate to be a part of! Ada used to call strangers \u201cfriends that I haven\u2019t met yet\u201d (except that one time she called a nice man \"sassy Robert\"), so let's all try to take her wisdom into the world and be kind to each other for her.\nLove,\nJoel, Tami Swenson, Ada's Spark (www.adas-spark.org)\nShow less",

We miss Ada so much and know that she would want us to spread joy in her memory so our non-profit (adas-spark.org) is organizing a toy drive for our local hospital. Click the link below or read on for more information. Thank you!\n\nAda\u2019s Spark Toy Drive Benefiting AFCH (2024) https://www.amazon.com/registries/gl/guest-view/1K3LZR7KBINRX\nGifts need to arrive by December 4th\nAmazon items will automatically ship to the Swenson\u2019s house\nMessage us here or reach out to https://adas-spark.org/contact-us/ with questions.\nThere is a printable flyer attached to this post if you want to promote this outside of social media.\n\nAda loved the hospital. This was not only due to the incredible loving staff, but also due to all of the fun toys, games, and activities she was given. She relapsed just before Christmas 2022 and was readmitted to American Family Children's Hospital (AFCH) in Madison. Generous gifts she received at the hospital shed some light on the darkness during the Holidays.\n\nWe want to pay it forward in her honor by hosting a toy drive for AFCH in Madison. This list includes toys that are in high demand that the hospital requested and toys that Ada loved and helped get her through some of the toughest days. So if you are looking for ways to help others who are going through some tough times this year, please consider participating in the 2024 Ada\u2019s Spark Toy Drive. We will have it open until December 4th so that we can deliver all these toys to AFCH before the holidays! No kid should have to spend the Holidays in the hospital but let's show them that they aren\u2019t alone! Thank you!!\nShow less",

        "text": "Tami Swenson and I are excited to announce that we are hosting a 5k run and a 1 mile walk in Ada's honor to raise money for childhood cancer research and to support children and their families affected by cancer: \"Ada's Forever 5k\". We have many, many details to plan still but wanted to share that it will be the morning of June 8th, 2024 (which would have been Ada's 6th birthday) in Waunakee. If you can't make it to Waunakee we will also plan a virtual option (basically you just walk/run where you live). If you want to help plan or know someone or a company that might donate equipment (e.g. bounce house), time/talent (e.g. facepainter), supplies (e.g. food, drinks), match donations, etc please reach out to either Tami or me. We are also in the process of setting up an IRS-qualified 501(c)(3) public charity so donations will be tax deductible for organizations and individuals. We look forward to seeing some of you there!\nShow less",

        "title": "December 31, 2023 - Update and request for help from our Appleton/Neenah friends",
        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm not sure if folks still monitor/get alerts here but wanted to share a quick update and also get some help trying to pass a bill funding childhood cancer research.\n\nRequest for help if you live in Appleton or Neenah:\nTami and I are both getting involved with various organizations to help families currently battling childhood cancer or leukemia. We know how devastating cancer can be and want to do our part. I'm volunteering (just got started basically!) with the MACC and ACCO organizations and we are helping introduce a bill into the Wisconsin State Legislature that establishes a state administered trust that would exclusively fund pediatric cancer research in the state of Wisconsin. They have a Representative and Senator interested in championing the bill but we want to gather constituents from the legislators' districts to help speed things up. If any of you live in Sen. Cabral-Guevera's (Appleton/Neenah) district (see the district map here) and are willing to help please let me know (joel.swenson at gmail dot com). We'd like these constituents to join us for a Zoom meeting to get caught up and prepped. After this, we will schedule a meeting for them to join us on a call with their representative....I was told it would be about a 1 hour time commitment total. Let me know if you know of anyone and I'm happy to provide more information or speak with them directly!\n\nSwenson Family Update:\nWe are doing okay. We miss her everyday and continue to love her so much. After talking to others who have lost a child I don't think that I will every stop grieving or missing her and that is ok. I'm slowly starting to find more joy in memories of her (rather than only sorrow and longing). The grief definitely comes in waves and some days are harder than others. Christmas and Thanksgiving both had their hard moments for all of us as we missed Ada and reminisced of fond memories with her. Fortunately it wasn't as bad as we feared (which maybe isn't saying much) and we were able to make both Holidays enjoyable for Oliver and Ellie while starting some new traditions to honor and remember Ada. I'll share a few here since I know that you all cared so much about her. On Christmas eve we put a gift for Oliver and a gift for Ellie inside Ada's stocking and told them that if Ada could have given them a gift this is what we think it would have been. Oliver got a slime dinosaur fossil (it was so messy, Ada would have approve) and Ellie received a Mini-Mouse dress-up toy (she and Ada both love(d) Mini-Mouse and dress-up). This helped us focus on Oliver and Ellie on Christmas itself. In downtown Waunakee we got to decorate a Christmas tree in her honor and hold a nice ceremony with other families that lost loved ones. We also coordinated a toy drive for American Family Children's Hospital in Madison. Ada, Oliver, and Ellie all got so many toys from them which brightened their days. We are so grateful that family, friends, and Ada's old daycare (Inspire - Ellie is there part-time now) opened up their hearts (and shopping carts!) to purchase over 350 gifts that the hospital will give to sick children and their families....Tami and I made the wish list with input from the hospital and it included many of Ada's favorite and distinctively Ada toys. The care staff will think of her often as they find sticky balls attached to the ceiling or scamper away from remote control spiders. Hopefully the gifts spread joy to patients, family, and staff. Our neighborhood friends also purchased 4 trikes with the Ada logo on them for the hospital to use! We feel so grateful to everyone who contributed and will probably advertise it on here next year as we hope to coordinate this annually. We didn't share it on here this year (I know that not everyone is on Facebook) because we were unprepared for how quickly the gifts were purchased.  \n\nWe also got a puppy in early December. We have been wanting one for like 5 years but delayed it when we moved to Wisconsin, then when Ellie was born, and again when Ada got sick. Ada loved dogs, she probably never laughed more at the hospital than when playing fetch with the therapy dogs. One of the last times she was able to walk around the hospital she proudly took the leash and stiffly walked the therapy dog down the hallway. For some reason Ada always named her stuffed animals \"Ogo\" so that is what we named him. He is a Portuguese Water Dog, which means that he is hypoallergenic (Tami is allergic to dogs) and will grow into a great family dog. They are known to have especially challenging puppyhood and we can confirm that he is keeping us busy. Oliver and Ellie love him to pieces.\n\nTami went back to work a few months ago. She stopped working May of 2022 when Ada was diagnosed so its been a transition. She works on trying to bring more life-saving pharmaceuticals to patients and has requested to focus more on oncology drugs. I admire her courage as she navigates through familiar drugs or reads about familiar side-effects on a daily basis. I am taking a break from working so that Tami can catch up a bit in her career with less stress at home and I can focus on continuing to help and provide support for Oliver and Ellie as they grieve in their own ways.\n\nIts hard to imagine next year being better than this year since next year we won't have any days with Ada physically present with us. We know that she would want us to live life to the fullest, laugh, help others, and love one another so we will try do so and hope that you all can as well. We thank you all again for your support and love.\nShow less",

They said to tell you that you will aways remember, grieve and miss Ada everyday, that will never change. However, they say that the memories are special and you will eventually appreciate that you have these special loving memories. They recommend you laugh, hug, love , create some new traditions and enjoy the memories! (even 24 years later.)\nWith all of our love,\nElise and friends\nShow less",

        "text": "Its been over a month since we lost Ada. We have spent the time starting the process of grieving, having some events in Ada's honor, and making some headway on how we want to honor her moving forward. Most of all we have been missing Ada. Some days/night/early mornings are tougher than others but on a whole we are slowly trending in the right direction. We keep hearing from others living with loss that the grief comes in cycles but that eventually you are able to remember the happy times with more joy than sorrow.\nOn August 12th Tami, Oliver, Ellie, my parents, Tami's parents, my brother's family, Tami's sister's family, and I went to the outdoor section of Ada's beloved daycare, Inspire. Tami and I read a eulogy that we wrote, and our dad's shared some memories and wisdom, then we released some butterflies. It was a beautiful moment as we stood on top of the hill overlooking where Ada first learned to ride a trike, where she frolicked with friends and where she did a lot of learning and loving. Afterwards, Ada's cousins enjoyed some of Ada's favorite activities while the adults supervised, shared more stories, cried, and laughed. The eulogy that Tami and I wrote and read is below. It was hard to read but Oliver ran over on his own accord to squeeze our hands to support us. Ellie was just the right amount of cute with random interruptions to help us get through it as well.\n[Spoken by Joel] \u201cA child can teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.\u201d \u2013 Paulo Coelho. Ada did all three with style. She was such a big personality and was never shy about asking for what she wanted. Her teachers and caregivers used many words to describe her including: happy, caring, energetic, curious, smart, limit-testing, strong-willed. We would describe her as love, joy, and playfulness personified but we don\u2019t really know how to describe something we loved so much and so hard. When we married the love and joy in our lives increased, when we had Oliver it increased more than we could imagine, Ada and Ellie each made that joy expand exponentially again. The love we have for our kids is limitless and forever. Losing Ada is more painful than we could ever have imagined but we will always have more joy in our life for having known Ada.\nSince Ada was born she did everything to keep us on our toes including bending in half while asleep and sleeping face first into her crib! She enjoyed giving the best belly laughs, riding on a roomba vacuum, making faces, dancing in nature, playing in the rain and mud, and when Ellie was born Ada turned into a little mom whether Ellie liked it or not. Once we were out on Papa Swenson\u2019s pontoon boat on Lake Mendota, we were deciding if we wanted to jump into the cold green water when we noticed Ada climbing down the ladder into the water, this made her wimp of a Dad jump in quickly! Ada had such fun ways of saying things: oatmeal was meatmeal, Oliver was Aldo, water towers were water mountains. At dinner every night she would lead our family ritual by asking everyone \u201cwhat are you grateful for\u201d, we said many times that we were grateful for family and her not being physically with us doesn\u2019t change that.\nAfter Ada was diagnosed she was in the hospital for most of 14 months but the fun for her did not stop. Her body and spirit were remarkably strong, we would be told that she would likely feel pretty bad and have low energy but her body was spared many of those common side effects and her spirit fought so hard against them when they were present. We have innumerable stories of her crying in pain or having a fever and many times just metaphorically (and sometimes literally) yelling \u201cI just want to play\u201d. She would then proceed to do so. One such story is that Ada spiked a high fever but refused to stay in her room, she wanted to go for a bike ride so we packed up our things and headed off, after around 10 minutes she stopped, threw up in a bag and just kept going. Shortly before Ada passed away I was called and told to get to the hospital ASAP, the medical staff thought that the end was near. By the time I got there Ada was insisting (to the nurse\u2019s dismay) through pain and countless medicines that she wanted to go to the playroom. Ultimately Ada won the battle of wills and made a mess in the playroom. \n[Spoken by Tami] Ada loved to play doctor at the hospital with her dolls, sit at the nurses station and type away \u201ccharting\u201d on a computer, she had her own office (the family consult room) where she would talk on the phone, chart, give her parents shots, or give Chester his medicines. One time Joel told her to check Chester for a blood return, she looked at him and said \u201cDaddy, Chester isn\u2019t real\u201d. Ada\u2019s quirky personality was further demonstrated when she met sassy robert. We were walking through the hallway in the hospital when she stopped a big burley tattooed biker man and demanded to know his name. He said, \u201cRobert\u2026\u201d. She said \u201cyou are a sassy Robert\u201d and they both continued on their way\u2026\nWhen Joel or I stepped out of the room, she would say \u201chug and kiss\u201d and spread her arms open. At night she would ask us to stop dinosaurs and chewbacca at the door, she ultimately became convinced that our farts kept him away.\nAda, your spirit will stay with us forever and the pain of losing you will forever be here as a reminder. A reminder to never take life for granted. We don\u2019t know how long we will be here as we have learned all too well that everything can change in an instant. So be like Ada: take chances, be the change you want to see in the world, fight for what you want and what you need, be fiercely curious, tell your friends and family you love them, treat each other with respect, and just enjoy life. Ada, you have taught us that. Whenever we face a difficult decision or moment we will remember you and ask ourselves, \u2018what would Ada do\u2019. If you do anything less, you know Ada would wag her little finger at you and say \u201cno no\u201d. So let's honor her and live life how she did and how she would want everyone she loved to. She may be gone but she is far from forgotten. \nOne of the last things Ada said to us was \u201cThank you for loving me\u201d, thank you Ada for loving us and letting us love you. The very last thing she said was \u201cLets go wake Ellie up\u201d which to us indicates that she was thinking of others and wanting to play with them right up to the end. We love you forever.\n  On August 13th we had a celebration of life for Ada. We are so grateful to friends and family who helped with activities/food, purchased some of the supplies, monitored some of the stations, etc. Most of all we are thankful to everyone who was able to attend (we know others wish that they could have and we totally understand). It meant a lot to have family and friends come together from near and far to honor Ada and also show their support to our family. Ada would have loved the event. It had: nail painting & tattoos, sand art, slime, play-doh, rock painting, a bounce house, bubbles & chalk, yard games, photo boards, polaroid-like camera to take pictures, photo/art wall, slideshow, disney music, memory book, capes, and \"fight like a kid\" magnets. Most important to us and I'm sure Ada, was the lovely people who were all there. I know that Ada would have been running from one activity to another, playing mother to the little kids, and showing the big kids that she could do everything that they can do. We are happy that Ada's friends were able to do the above for her in memory of her. Tami and I only wish that we had more time to chat, cry, and laugh with all the amazing people who showed up. Tami and I poured a lot of love and tears into organizing it but it was a labor of love. Thank you all who were there physically or in spirit. We love you all.\nEvery family at the Celebration of Life received a magnet with a picture of Ada and the saying \"Fight Like a Kid\". The magnet station had a sheet of paper explaining what that means to us:\nAda was the epitome of the saying \u201cFight Like a Kid\u201d. \nWe think it's a good way to live.\nAda biked, ran, laughed, and played through 14 months of grueling cancer treatments. She didn't let pain, nausea or fevers get in her way. She accepted what was thrown her way, including love and help, and found ways to make life fun and entertaining. She taught us how to live a long standing family mantra of ours: \u201cLife isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...It's about learning to dance in the rain\u201d. \nAda was going to do great things and make the world a better place. She can\u2019t do that with her body anymore, so we ask that you all carry her spirit onward. Put this magnet somewhere you will see it every day and spread her joy and caring throughout your communities and through your actions: \"How can I be a little more kind/cheeky/helpful today? How can I make the world a better place in her memory?\". Don\u2019t take anything for granted, don't let anyone hold you back, do what makes you feel fulfilled, love and help others, and enjoy every single moment. \nFight (through life) like a kid in honor of Ada!\n*If you did not get a magnet, let us know! We have lots of leftovers!!\nOn August 17th, Waunakee unveiled a mural for those in the community who lost a loved one at an early age. It is a large butterfly with smaller butterflies surrounding it. The smaller butterflies are the names (including Ada) of lost but not forgotten community members. It was a nice event with food, music, inspirational speeches, a reading of all the names, and a butterfly release. They also gave all the families a butterfly chrysalis. Our butterfly emerged at our house on August 22nd, exactly 1 month after Ada's death. Oliver named the butterfly Ada and released it in our backyard where she eagerly flew off into the world.\nThis past weekend some of our amazing neighbors invited us to their cabin up north and absolutely spoiled us, not letting us cook or clean and helping out a bunch with the kids. It was the most relaxed Tami and I have been in a very, very long time. Tami and I had been keeping our social circle extremely small due to COVID and then Ada's compromised immune system so on top of all the great food and amenities (boat, jet ski, kayak, speakeasy, etc) we most appreciated the good company. So if you are reading this lets get together and do something fun to help us all heal! \nWhen Ada was alive we had a dinner time tradition of going around the table and everyone sharing a \"rose\" (what you are grateful for), a \"bud\" (what you are looking forward to), and a \"thorn\" (what you are sad about/worried about/etc). Ada used to lead the tradition and wouldn't let anyone off the hook. We continue this tradition in her absence and even though our thorns are sharp enough to pierce hearts, the roses and buds that you all have provided and that we provide each other propel us to fight for joy, love, and hope to conquer sorrow. This has been a heartbreaking journey but countless people (many we don't even know) have loved and supported us. Think about that next time you see only hate and fear in the media, the world is mostly full of loving, amazing people. Please keep spreading that light and love throughout your communities.\nShow less",

        "text": "Hi all,\nWe are all doing ok here, as well as can be expected. For us its been true what they say, that the sorrow comes in waves. We've been making a point to get outside, spend time with others and find joy throughout the day. We continue to be overwhelmed by the support from you all and our community. Your messages of support, your hugs on the sidewalk, the special moments/experiences folks have provided for our kids in the past week, friends/family inviting us over and spending time with us, etc has helped more than you know.\nTami and I have been planning a celebration of life for Ada. All of you are more than welcome to stop in anytime on August 13th between 1:30 - 4:30 at the Waunakee Village Center (333 S Madison St, Waunakee, WI 53597). There will be light snacks, lots of pictures of Ada, and many stations of her favorite activities.  We know that there will be sad moments as we think of Ada not being able to join us in those activities but we hope it will be a happy day as we celebrate her wonderful but short life. You are welcome to wear whatever but we suggest wearing colorful fun outfits and dress your kids in something they can get messy in. :)\nAlso on August 17th Ada's name (along with others) will be read as she has a butterfly painted in her honor in downtown Waunakee. It is a mural being dedicated to those in the community who lost a loved one. https://www.nbc15.com/2023/07/09/waunakee-mural-honor-lives-lost-loved-ones/ We can share more details on the ceremony when we receive them.\nIn lieu of flowers please consider donating blood, signing up to be a bone marrow donor at bethematch.org, or support the UW Kids Cancer Research Fund in her name here: http://give.wiscmedicine.org/AdaSwenson\n\nAda's obituary: https://www.cressfuneralservice.com/.../adalyn-ada-swenson\nAs always, thank you all for the support you've given us and continue to give.\nShow less",

In the days since Ada\u2019s passing, we have reflected on her life, the good memories and the hard memories. But most of all we have reflected on Ada\u2019s personality \u2013 loving, spunky, sassy, determined, and curious. This personality was a blessing to us as grandparents. She reminded us to live life in two important ways;\nShe demonstrated unconditional love; love of people, love of living. Her love was shown through the fun she could find in nearly any situation. Things like convincing Doctors to play catch with her sticky balls, helping papa drive the boat and managing to sneak her finger to the red button blowing the horn startling everyone, or telling silly stories to each other. In her final days telling her Mayme don\u2019t cry, I\u2019ll be okay. You could see her love through the spark in her eyes.\nShe viewed the world around with wonder and awe. The joys she took from the little things in life were amazing. Hiking through the neighborhood with Ada between treatments, spending time watching the ants and wondering what they were doing, going hunting for dinosaurs and investigating all nature had to offer.\nOur hearts ache with our loss of our sweet little girl. As we go forward, we hope we can take these lessons from our sweet Ada and live life the way she would want us to.\nThank you everyone for your love and support!\nKaren & Mark (Mayme and Papa)\nShow less",

        "text": "Ada died peacefully this morning at 2:47AM. She was cuddled between Tami and me and hugged and kissed her as she took her last breath. Over the past few days she has been surrounded by family and Tami and I have not left her side. We got so many cuddles and kisses in. Her pain was uncontrolled several days ago but thanks to copious amounts of medication she has been peaceful for a bit now. Even when she was in pain and we were told her death could be imminent she insisted on being pushed around in her wheelchair and handing out pez (people tried to say \"no\" to the pez but she wouldn't let them) or going to the playroom. As you can imagine Tami and I have been telling her that we love her a lot lately. After one of those times Ada said \"thank you for loving me\" then she said \"I love you too\". A little later we both got big hugs and a kiss on the lips from her. Words can't capture the love and joy from those moments but we will carry them in our heart. Wednesday night she got sooo much morphine (and other drugs) that we thought we wouldn't have any more lucid moments from her, as we all know Ada is a fighter. She woke up Thursday morning flitted her eyes open and said \"Glad that you are here\". Late afternoon Thursday we tickled her and she said \"Lets go wake Ellie up\". Multiple times over the past few days different doctors and nurses have said that they've never seen someone fight so hard or come back from the brink so many times...typical strong Ada.\nShe and we (and all of you) fought so hard over the last 1+ years. Ada got the best and most care that her body could handle. We are indebted to our local medical professionals/experts as well as all the world experts who consulted with us and/or treated Ada. As far as I'm concerned Ada fought and won all the battles that were in her control. She never felt sorry for herself, never stopped playing, never stopped bossing the nurses around \"her feistiness makes us laugh\", never stopped caring for others (especially her baby sister and her big brother), never stopped goofing and laughing.\nAda had a good life, with lots of friends, family, joy, and fun experiences. Since her diagnosis in May of 2022 she has spent around 250 days in a hospital and closer to 300 away from home (i.e. not inpatient but out of our home for care). For the vast majority of that time she was having a ball including laughing, playing with nurses, playing with hospital dogs, having school in the hospital, finding the messiest toys/paint/sand and enjoying them, exploring hospitals by foot/bike/wagon/toy fire truck and talking to strangers, playing with us and making us smile, etc. This past year + was undoubtably hard but Ada taught us how to live a longstanding family mantra of Tami and mine \u201cLife isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...It's about learning to dance in the rain.\u201d Your support and encouragement made this possible. Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts.\nAda wouldn\u2019t want this to be a sad day but it will have sadness, I want it to have joy as well. I want to celebrate her life. When Tami and I married, the love and joy in our lives increased. When we had Oliver it increased more than we could imagine. Ada and Ellie each made that joy expand exponentially again. The love we have for our kids is forever and despite some joy being sucked out of it today we will always have more joy in our life for having known Ada.\nPlease respond with a story of Ada that you will remember or a lesson that she taught you. It doesn't have to be long, eloquent, or profound. If you can't think of one today come back and leave one some other time.\nWe will share more details on a memorial service in the coming days but want to leave on this note. Ada brought so much joy and wisdom into the world. Her body is gone now but we are going to challenge ourselves and you all to bring her joy into the world with you. We know that there will be sadness and grief with us (and many of you) for the rest of our lives but Ada wouldn't want us to be consumed by it. She was going to do great things and make the world a better place. I contend that she already has and wants everyone to spread her joy and caring throughout their communities. Put a picture of her up on your fridge or write her name on a piece of paper where you see it everyday. Don't only look back on her life with sadness but when you see that reminder of her carry it with you into the world and think \"how can I be a little kinder today, how can I help others, how can I make the world a better place in her memory\". And finally, she has taught us to not take anything for granted. Live life to the fullest- don't let anyone hold you back, do what makes you feel fulfilled, love and help others and enjoy every single moment.\nWe all love you so much Ada, thank you for letting us be a part of your world for 5 glorious years.\n-Joel and Tami\nShow less",

Ada had this truly amazing way of balancing magnanimity, grace, and whimsy through it all, time and again.\n\nFor her birthday this year, I sent her a video of me and Sharkey\u2014my sometime video-call companion who also happens to be a talking toy shark head. Later that day, I learned that our ventriloquistic greeting apparently caused quite a bit of gleeful giggling! Although Ada and I (and Sharkey) never did meet, I\u2019ll always be glad that we shared these little joy-filled moments.\n\nThank you for your gift of joy and genuine connection, Ada. They are the greatest gifts of all.\n\n\u201cThe greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\u201d \u2014 eden ahbez, \"Nature Boy\" (song recorded by Nat King Cole)\nShow less",

One particular fond memory Erik and I have is seeing Ada truly flying at high speed on her tricycle down the sidewalk with her G-tube in place (and Joel worriedly chasing after her) shortly after she started her first cancer treatment. To me, that image captures Ada\u2019s joyful spirit, unburdened zest for life, and fierce determination; I will keep these sentiments with me as an honor to her memory and as inspiration in my own life.\n\nTami and Joel - I am truly in awe of the love you have for your family, your dedication to your children, your positivity, and the grace your have demonstrated throughout Ada\u2019s cancer journey. I wish you and your family strength and peace. Ada is very missed, but her spirit lives on in more ways than you can know.\n\nSincerely,\nAmanda\nShow less",

Throughout the past 14 + months the words you have written on the Caringbridge pages allowed so many people to really get to know your special girl.\n\nI remember during the pandemic meeting you outdoors \"up north\" and taking a hike around Shannon Lake with Oliver and Ada. (Ellie was at that time just a discussion about the merits of a mini-van and if we liked the one we have....we were not surprised about the pregnancy announcement a month or so later.) What stood out the most for me during our hike was Ada's intense curiosity. We had to stop for her to inspect many small pieces of nature. One of my favorite memories is when she was lying flat on her tummy on the boardwalk inspecting all that the boardwalk was covering.\n\nFast forward to September 2021. We were invited to Mark and Karen's. What I remember most about that day was being amazed at how much taller Ada had become and how very determined she was to keep up with her older brother and Luke and Jack, racing up and down the hills at break-neck speed with great joy and somehow keeping up with those older boys. I also remember her snuggling up with great-grandma Fern, a special bond between those two was apparent. Next, on to March 2022 at Jasmin's first birthday party. While there were a lot of people there what I noticed about Ada was her immediate love for Gaya (Erik and Vera's golden retriever) and how sweet Ada was to Jasmin.\n\nThen came May 2022 and everything changed. The stories you shared through the CaringBridge website allowed us all to see her curiosity. She handled having a port better than anyone I know and I am sure learned so much \"helping\" the nurses work in their workstations. Her joy and determination were obvious with the sticky balls being thrown to the ceiling, putting make-up on doctors, the countless miles spent driving her trike around the hospital hallways often with a cape flapping in the breeze behind her, the insisting on going to the playroom in her final days. Through your journaling you were able to capture how loving Ada was. The way she loved mothering Ellie and playing with Oliver. The ever-ready smile. The love of the therapy dog. The kisses and hugs. The thanking you for being there....\n\nAda taught us all so many things. Be curious. Be joyful. Be determined. Have fun. Play....Dance in the rain.\n\nAda will be missed, but NEVER forgotten. We love you.\nShow less",

She received treatment through Tuesday of this week and then that night pain consumed her and the cancer came roaring back. Typically treatment would slow things down for weeks at a time but lately she has been blasting through treatments as fast as we can give them. We've tried everything and talked to all the experts, all that's left is to get her pain under control and enjoy the time we have left. It took a few days and LOTS of morphine (and other meds), but she is finally resting (here at the hospital in Madison). Based on this and her breathing patterns, we were told she has hours or maybe days left. We are spending every remaining moment just holding her and talking to her. She is comfortable and right now that is all that matters.\nAs always thank you all for your support and love, we've relied so much on all of you. We will provide another update in the coming days.\nLove Tami and Joel\nShow less",
