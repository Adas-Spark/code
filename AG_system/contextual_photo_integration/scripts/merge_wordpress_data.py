    # In the second merge, it was `right_on='normalized_stem_wp'`.
    # Let's explicitly drop the helper columns created on the main dataframe:
    final_cleanup_cols = ['normalized_stem_lineage_full', 'normalized_stem_lineage_thumb']
    # Also drop the 'normalized_stem_wp' if it was brought from the right side and not renamed.
    # After the first merge, 'normalized_stem_wp' (from wordpress_df) is not needed.
    # After the second merge, 'normalized_stem_wp' (from wordpress_df) is not needed.
    # The `wordpress_df[['normalized_stem_wp', ...]]` syntax should prevent other columns from wordpress_df from polluting.
    # The `suffixes` ensure that 'filename' and 'url' are uniquely named.
    # The `normalized_stem_wp` on the right side of the merge does not get added to the final_merged_df unless specified in select, or if it was also a col in left.
    # So, the primary columns to drop are those created on the left DataFrame for merging.

    # in `final_merged_df` unless it was part of the selection or an overlapping column name from the left table.
    # The explicit selection `wordpress_df[['normalized_stem_wp', 'filename', 'url']]` means `normalized_stem_wp` is used as the key
    # and `filename`, `url` are the values brought in. If `normalized_stem_wp` is not also in the left table's columns,
    # it won't be duplicated.
    # The `suffixes` only apply if columns *other than the merge key* have the same name.

    # Let's be explicit about what we expect in `wordpress_df` for the merge:
    # `wordpress_df_subset_full = wordpress_df[['normalized_stem_wp', 'filename', 'url']]`
    # `merged_df = pd.merge(lineage_df, wordpress_df_subset_full, ...)`
    # `wordpress_df_subset_thumb = wordpress_df[['normalized_stem_wp', 'filename', 'url']]`
    # `final_merged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, wordpress_df_subset_thumb, ...)`
    # This structure means 'normalized_stem_wp' is used as the key and won't create extra output columns named 'normalized_stem_wp_x' etc.
    # So, we only need to drop the keys created on the left dataframe:
    
    final_merged_df.drop(columns=final_cleanup_cols, inplace=True, errors='ignore')
