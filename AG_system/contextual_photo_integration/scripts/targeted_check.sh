#                            TARGETED DEBUGGING SCRIPT
#
# PURPOSE:
# This script was created for targeted, manual debugging of the data pipeline.
# Its goal is to diagnose why specific files, known to be missing data in the
# final output, were failing to merge correctly.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# The script iterates through a hard-coded list of problematic filenames.
# For each filename, it performs two separate 'grep' searches to find the
# corresponding key in the two source CSV files:
#
#   1. 'processing_lineage.csv': The output from the local image processor.
#   2. 'wordpress_urls.csv': The data downloaded from the remote server.
#
# By displaying the matching keys from both files side-by-side, this script
# allows for a direct visual comparison, making it easy to spot subtle
# discrepancies like case-sensitivity (e.g., 'IMG' vs 'img'), character
# substitution (e.g., ' ' vs '-'), or special character handling (e.g., '~').
#
# This tool was instrumental in identifying that the filename "keys" needed
# to be normalized (lowercased, spaces and tildes replaced) before the
# final merge could succeed.
#
# =============================================================================

# A simple, targeted script to check a specific list of 5 files
# against the two source CSVs.

# --- Configuration: Define the paths to the files we are checking ---

WORDPRESS_URLS_FILE="lineage/wordpress_urls.csv"

echo "üî¨ Starting targeted check on 5 specific files..."
