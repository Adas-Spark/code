    "# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS\n",
    "# ==================\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Hybrid Search\n",
    "#    Implement hybrid search to combine vector similarity with keyword matching.\n",
    "#    This helps when users use different terminology than what's in our questions.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. Basic Re-ranking\n",
    "#    Add post-processing that re-ranks results based on exact phrase matches,\n",
    "#    keyword overlap, and category-specific boosts. This can improve relevancy\n",
    "#    without external APIs.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. Question Expansion\n",
    "#    Generate alternative phrasings for each question in the dataset.\n",
    "#    For example, \"What was Ada like?\" could become \"Tell me about Ada's personality\".\n",
    "#    This creates more entry points for queries.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. Synonym Handling\n",
    "#    Create mappings of synonyms for important terms (e.g., \"funny\" → \"humorous\",\n",
    "#    \"activities\" → \"hobbies\"). Expand queries with these synonyms to improve matching.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. Multi-Strategy Search\n",
    "#    Try several search approaches in parallel (vector, hybrid, expanded) and\n",
    "#    combine the results with different weights.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. Content Expansion\n",
    "#    Add more questions and answers to the dataset. Search quality typically\n",
    "#    improves dramatically with more content, especially when targeting different\n",
    "#    ways people might phrase the same question.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 7. Track & Learn from Queries\n",
    "#    Log actual search queries and use them to identify gaps in coverage.\n",
    "#    Add new questions based on common user searches.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 8. Parameter Tuning\n",
    "#    Experiment with different values for hybrid search alpha, re-ranking weights,\n",
    "#    and similarity thresholds to optimize for our specific use case."
